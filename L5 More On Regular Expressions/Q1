Question 1:

Provide a new regular expression that will find three adjacent digits, different from the one you provided in last lesson's homework. Include your previous answer.

Your Answer:
re.search("[1-9]{3}", Text_to_Search)

Question 2:

What is the difference between re.match() and re.search()?

Your Answer:
match() checks at the start of a string and returns None if nothing is found.

search() moves up the string, looking for the first occurrence of the given pattern, and returns None only if the 
pattern occurs nowhere in the string.
