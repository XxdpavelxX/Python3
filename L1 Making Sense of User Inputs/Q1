Question 1:


Why should you not cut and paste the code when working in O'Reilly School of Technology courses? 

Your Answer:

Question 2:

What is a working set?

Your Answer:
A working set is a view of the workspace that behaves like a folder, but it's actually an association of files. Working sets allow you to limit the detail that you see at any given time. The difference between a working set and a folder is that a working set doesn't actually exist in the file system. A working set is a convenient way to group related items together.
