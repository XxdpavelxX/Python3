Question 1:

Which techniques can be used to receive input from the command line?

Your Answer:
1.optparse library
2.argparse
3.sys.argv
Mentor Comments:
right, argparse is another one, very similar to optparse and due to replace it eventually
(more code probably still uses optparse -- not a bad idea to learn it first, then 
argparse will seem simple).  Good research.

Your Answer:
parser.add_option()

Your Answer:
No.


Question 5:

Your Answer:
