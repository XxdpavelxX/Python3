Question 1:

With a single line of code, create a memory efficient iterator from which a for loop could obtain a million numbers. What is the technique called?

Your Answer:
a = (c for c in range(0, 1000000))
This technique is known as generator expression.
Mentor Comments:
a = (c for c in range(1000000))


Question 2:


What is the difference between list comprehension and a generator expression?

Your Answer:
They are used in different circumstance. For example:

If a result has to be stored and iterated more than one time, then a list comprehension is used because generator expression will only iterate one time.

On the other hand, when data range is very large or infinite, a generator expression is better to use because it can create items as it goes and takes up less space in the memory.
Mentor Comments:
right.  A trend in computing which Agile encompasses is "just in time" meaning don't compute it before you need it, as you may end up not needing it


Question 3:

What is the tool used in the correct answer to question 1 above?
1.list comprehension 
2.tuple 
3.generator expression
4.list generator 
5.None of the above

Your Answer:
