Question 1:


What is a good way to manage data and its custom behaviors across multiple programs?

Your Answer:
Object Oriented Programming.



Question 2:


What is a bunch class?

Your Answer:
A bunch class takes incoming data and saves it as attributes.



Question 3:


Should you include a test for code inside the main program, and why or why not?

Your Answer:
No. The code would always imports the unittest module even when it is not going to be used 
(when the module is imported rather than running as a main program). You can correct this by moving both
the import of unittest and the code for the test class itself so that these pieces of code are only 
executed when required. Also writing tests seperately makes code more straightforward and does not 
cause additional work when testing is not required.
